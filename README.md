# Finite State Automata Application #

The web application is built on Java. It allows us to create finite state machines.

### Some of the functionality: ###
* The machine.txt file hold all the 8 machines.
* The output.txt file hold the output of the program.
* Compile the Project1.java in any IDE.
* Or compile through command line
  (javac Project1.java)
  (java Project1)

### Note ###
* The program currently cannot run Dfsa by subset construction.
* (FSA 1-4) works fine.
